# ML-models-comparison

Given a data set from a clinical trial. I used 3 types of prediction models and compare between them.
The first model is a linear classifier.
The second one is an ensemble model.
The third is a DL one.

I used the concepts of: train/validation/test split, grid-search, cross validation etc.
in order to find the best parameters for each model.

In the end I preformed a comparison between the 3 models and explained why I chose the LR model.
